# PiPlane: A DIY FPV Plane with Raspberry Pi, ELRS/CRSF, Matek System Driver, and IC12 Servos

## Project Overview

This project provides a detailed guide and codebase (if applicable) for building a custom FPV (First-Person View) plane using a Raspberry Pi as the flight controller. Here are the core components:

- **Radio Protocol:** ELRS or CRSF (Crossfire) for low-latency, reliable communication
- **Flight Controller:** Matek System Driver (MSD) for advanced flight control capabilities
- **Servos:** IC12 servos for precise control of the aircraft's surfaces

## Target Audience

This project is geared towards experienced DIY enthusiasts and hobbyists with a solid understanding of:

- Raspberry Pi hardware and software setup
- FPV flight dynamics and control theory
- Basic knowledge of radio protocols like ELRS or CRSF
- Soldering and electronics assembly skills

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (model selection depends on processing power and peripheral needs)
- ELRS or CRSF compatible receiver and transmitter
- Matek System Driver (MSD) flight controller board
- IC12 servos (quantity based on your chosen aircraft design)
- Brushless motors and Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) suitable for your aircraft's size and weight
- FPV camera and video transmitter
- Battery (capacity and voltage based on motor requirements and flight time)
- Servo control horns and linkages
- Propeller(s) appropriate for your chosen motor and aircraft configuration
- Miscellaneous hardware (screws, nuts, wires, etc.) for assembly

## Software Requirements

- Raspberry Pi operating system (e.g., Raspbian)
- ELRS or CRSF configuration software for your specific radio system
- Matek System Driver (MSD) configuration software (https://www.mateksys.com/?p=5712)
- Optional: Video recording and telemetry software

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Assembly:**
   - Carefully assemble your PiPlane, following best practices for electronics assembly (e.g., proper soldering techniques, secure connections).
   - Ensure all components are securely mounted and properly connected.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Flash the Raspberry Pi with a suitable operating system (e.g., Raspbian).
   - Install the ELRS or CRSF configuration software and configure your radio system.
   - Use the Matek System Driver (MSD) configuration software to set up the flight controller parameters, including motor mapping, servo assignments, and safety features.
   - (Optional) Install video recording and telemetry software if desired.

3. **Calibration and Testing:**
   - Carefully calibrate the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) of the MSD flight controller, following the specific instructions for your hardware.
   - Perform thorough ground testing before attempting flight. Verify proper motor direction, servo movement, and ensure there are no binding issues in the control surfaces.

4. **Flight Testing:**
   - Begin flight testing in a safe, open area with no obstacles, preferably with an experienced FPV pilot present for guidance.
   - Start with short, low-altitude flights to gradually gain confidence and fine-tune the flight controller settings as needed.

## Important Notes

- **Safety:** FPV flying can be hazardous. Always prioritize safety by adhering to local regulations, maintaining a safe flying environment, and being fully prepared for potential emergencies.
- **Disclaimer:** This project is provided for informational purposes only. The authors and contributors assume no responsibility for any damages or injuries that may occur during construction, testing, or operation of the PiPlane.
- **Customization:** This guide provides a general framework. You may need to adapt it based on your specific hardware choices and aircraft design.
- **Community and Support:** Consider joining online forums and communities dedicated to FPV flight and DIY projects to seek advice, share experiences, and learn from others.

## Codebase Structure (if applicable)

- Provide a clear overview of the codebase organization (e.g., folders, files).
- Explain the purpose of each code file or component.

## Additional Considerations

**Power Management:** Discuss battery selection, voltage regulation, and any necessary power filtering to ensure clean power to your Raspberry Pi and other electronics.

**Frame Design and Materials:** Briefly touch upon the choice of frame material (e.g., wood, foam, carbon fiber), its impact on weight and durability, and resources for finding suitable designs.

**FPV System Integration:** Describe the FPV camera and video transmitter setup, including their installation and configuration.

**Telemetry (Optional):** If using telemetry, explain how it's integrated with the Raspberry Pi and what data is being transmitted.
